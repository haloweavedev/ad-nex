## **üéØ Next Steps After Successful Testing**

1. **Expand tool functions** (booking, cancellation, etc.)
2. **Add authentication** and user context
3. **Implement database logging** for call records
4. **Create production assistant** configurations
5. **Set up monitoring** and alerting
6. **Test with real phone numbers** (if using phone assistant)

Remember: This is your testing foundation. Once these basic interactions work flawlessly, you can confidently build more complex features! üöÄ
